    <h3>Project Dates: January 2024</h3>


    <h3>Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>UI Design</li>
        <li>Presenting</li>
        <li>Startup Ideas</li>
    </ul>

    <p>PitcherVC is a mobile app that allows startups to spread their businesses and venture capitalists to easily swipe through startups in an easy-to-use format.</p>
    <p>The app connects startups through LinkedIn, and allows them to post 30-second pitches for their companies. VCs can then easily scroll through startups and swipe right to save a startup they like or swipe left to pass on a particular startup. VCs can
        then connect to the startups they swiped right on through LinkedIn.</p>
    <p>This project was co-designed with Tyler Bordeaux at Michigan State University during MLH SpartaHack 9. Tyler handled the software behind creating the app's functionality, while I helped with UI design, brainstorming, and presenting the project to
        the hackathon's judges. Check out the project's Devpost <a href="https://devpost.com/software/pitcher-vc">here</a>.</p>
