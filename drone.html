    <h3>Project Dates: January 2025 - March 2025</h3>

    <h3>Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3D Printing</li>
        <li>Motor Control</li>
        <li>Design</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This drone was designed using using a custom 3D printed frame designed for speed. We chose specific blades that were the most efficient during testing, and wired the motors to the circuit board and powered it with a battery. The board was then connected
        to a controller via QGroundControl and flown. During this class, our drones had to be designed for a specific task, and ours was speed. We chose the barebones design, light custom frame, and blades with this purpose in mind.</p>
    <p>This project was completed in UCLA's ENGR 1DR class in collaboration with three other classmates.</p>
