        <h3>Project Dates: October 2024 - May 2025</h3>
        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>PCB Design</li>
            <li>Soldering</li>
            <li>Microcontroller Programming</li>
            <li>Motors and Encoders</li>
            <li>IR Sensors</li>
            <li>Maze Navigation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Micromouse is an autonomous, maze-solving robot created entirely from scratch. Using IR sensors, motors with magnetic encoders, a custom PCB, and a Floodfill algorithm, the robot finds its way to the center of a maze through repeated iterations,
            eventually solving the maze with the most efficient path.</p>

        <p>I created a Micromouse by first creating a custom PCB for IR sensors, motors, an MCU (microcontroller unit), and H-Bridge (to control the motors), with a power switch and power LEDs as extra features. I also coded a Floodfill algorithm that would
            use stacks and queues to solve a maze by adding maze tile objects into the data structures, and upon solving the maze, look for a faster path to the center by going back to the starting point and iterating back and forth.</p>

        <p>Upon assembling the mouse, I used PID controllers (proportional, integral, derivative) to callibrate my Micromouse's motors to be able to execute 90˚ turns and drive straight. I then read IR data to detect when there were maze walls surrounding
            the mouse.
        </p>

        <p>This project culminated in competing in the All-American Micromouse Competition (AAMC) in May of 2025, where students from colleges around the country compete with their Micromouse.</p>

        <p>For the 2025-2026 school year, I was selected as the new Micromouse lead, where I teach the project to this year's students. Duties include presenting lectures, hosting worksessions, troubleshooting student mice, reviewing PCBs, and organizing
            this year's AAMC.</p>

        <h3>Micromouse II: September 2025 - Present</h3>
        <p>I plan to redesign my Micromouse, including optimizations to the Floodfill algorithm, PID constants, PCB layout, Battery Holders, and IR sensors and compete in AAMC this upcoming May.</p>
