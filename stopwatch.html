    <h3>Project Dates: November 2023 - January 2024</h3>
    <h3>Goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>PCB Design</li>
        <li>Soldering</li>
        <li>Microcontroller Programming</li>
        <li>3D Printing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For this project, I first used an Arduino Nano and breadboard to create a schematic with digital displays. I used PlatformIO to connect the digital displays to pins of the Nano and create an internal timer within the code, outputting the time in incrememnts
        of seconds to the digital displays.</p>
    <p>After testing the time functions of the code, I created a custom PCB in KiCad that would be equivalent to the breadboarded circuit, with additional spots for a power LED to indicate when the stopwatch was running and start/reset buttons.</p>
    <p>I added the additional button and LED functionality into the code, soldered on all the components onto the PCB, and after confirming its functionality, created a custom 3D printed case that would neatly fit as an enclosure, leaving space for a battery
        to power the microcontroller inside.</p>
